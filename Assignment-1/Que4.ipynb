    "To find optimal cost, the algorithm I have used is brute force i.e. I try all possible centers, calculate the cost and then take minimum cost among all. The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^{k+1}kd)$, where $d$ is the dimension of data set. Hence, with $n = 8950$ and $k = 2$ or $4$, this algorithm may take up hours, days or even centuaries to finish. \n",
